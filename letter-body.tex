Thank you for taking your time to read my application. 
My PhD on addressing distribution shift in robotic imitation learning will be wrapping up within the next few months, and I would love to work with the amazing team at \company. 
I am confident that my experience would make me a good fit. 
I have completed extensive research and applied work with manipulators, both mobile and static, in both the real world and in simulation. 
My research has focused primarily on imitation learning (aka learning from demonstration), (inverse) reinforcement learning, and human-robot interaction to generate high-performing policies.
Since I come from a lab where these lines of research were not the status quo, I was also responsible for developing and integrating significant portions of the robotics software stack to achieve these goals.

The algorithms that I’ve worked on have used a variety of different architectures and both image-based and state-based observations. 
I have used Pybullet, Mujoco, Gazebo, ROS, and ROS2 extensively, but I also have light experience with Isaac Sim and am keen on learning more and finding the best tool for whatever application I am working on.
My extensive work with robotic manipulators has ensured that I have strong fundamental knowledge of kinematics, dynamics, planning, perception, and control, and I have leveraged a variety of different sensing modalities (including visual, depth, and visuotactile) and approaches to motion generation.
A large portion of my work has required designing the pipeline for and then collecting real-world manipulation data and subsequently training a variety of neural network architecture policies.
All of my research projects are open source and freely available (see my CV for links), and while I primarily work in Python, PyTorch, and Tensorflow, I have experience and confidence with C++ as well.
As a first author, my work has been published in ICRA \cite{2024_Ablett_vpace}, IROS \cite{ablettSeeingAllAngles2021}, RA-L \cite{2023_Ablett_Learning}, T-RO \cite{2024_Ablett_Push}, NeurIPS \cite{2021_Ablett_Learning}, and CoRL \cite{ablettFastReinforcementLearning2024}.
% My recent work, ``Efficient Imitation Without Demonstrations via Value-Penalized Auxiliary Control from Examples” (ICRA 2025 submission), built directly on previous work from Deepmind (SAC-X) and was \href{https://x.com/m_wulfmeier/status/1864709951823675882}{tweeted by Markus Wulfmeier}.

I am currently based in Toronto, but I am willing to move for this position. 
As a Canadian citizen, acquiring legal work status in the USA with a TN Visa will not require significant effort.
Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you need further description of my background. Thank you again for your time.
